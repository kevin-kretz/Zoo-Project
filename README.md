## Introduction
A friend of mine is attending Southern New Hapshire University and took a class which is an introductory course to Java.  I was quite interested in the final project of the course and have never coded in Java before.  I had him send me the paperwork and this is the project that evolved from it.

## Process Documentation
You can find all of the instructions and supporting files needed in the <a href="./documentation">documentation folder</a> I created for this project.

## Overall Process:
I started this project off by making myself familiar with the syntax and basic ideas of Java by completeing the <a ref="https://www.codecademy.com/kevin.kretz">Java course on Codecademy</a>.  This wasn't as indepth as some of their other courses, but thanks to my background in Python, I felt like I got a decent understanding of the language.

After taking the course, I began by making a pseudo code of this project as the instructions recommended.  After creating the pseduocode, I began setting up Visual Studio Code with the necessary extensions to compile and run the code.  Finally I began coding the project, doing tons of Java research along the way.

## What I learned
- The use of Scanners, for both user input and reading documents
- The process of encryption, specifically MD5
- The basics of Java, including for/while loops, arrays, object oriented programming, functions and methods, and importing/usage of libraries.

## Final Code
You can run my final code through a sandbox made in sandbox.cs50.io <a href="https://sandbox.cs50.io/6c81e419-37bd-4c08-af02-ed1df93af027">here</a>, or you can simply view the code in <a href="./Authenticate.java">GitHub</a>.
